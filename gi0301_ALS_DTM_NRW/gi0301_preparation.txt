Dear Students,

next week we will start the topic "Airborne Laser Scanning" (ALS) and use official Digital Terrain Models (DTM) derived from ALS of our federal state of Nordrhein-Westfalen (NRW).

The ALS data is organized in tiles which are bundled in zip archives for each municipality (in our case "Xanten"). The original file format of each tile is a formatted text file with three columns for the x-y-z coordinates. Each row represents one point in space. In fact all points of a tile form a regular grid of 2000 x 2000 points with 1m distance between points in x- and y-direction.

The xyz text files are not suitable for processing in QGIS. Therefore we have to convert the XYZ format into a geoTiff format. 

Before we know which of the tiles have to be processed (are in our region of interest) we have to create a bounding box (georeferenced squared polygon) for all XYZ files in the archive. These polygons are added to a shapefile which is used in QGIS later on to identify the interesting tiles.

To prepare for this activity please:

1) Set up a Python3 development environment. I recommend the Anaconda distribution from https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/ 

2) Install the Python package gdal, e.g. by calling "conda install gdal" 

3) Run Jupyter Notebook, create a new notebook and check, whether you can execute the following command: "from osgeo import osr, ogr, gdal"

4) Download the ALS DTM zip archive of the municipality of Xanten (approx. 500 MB packed and 4 GB unpacked):
